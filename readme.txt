Disable WooCommerce Marketplace suggestions, ads and connect to woocommerce.com nags.


## Remove WooCommerce 3.6 Extension Ads

This plugin disables the WooCommerce Marketplace suggestions. The suggestions appears in the admin area. They can be located in-between your product list and on product edit pages These might be useful to newcomers though they can be a distraction to everyone else.

## Remove the "Connect your store to WooCommerce.com to receive extensions updates and support."

This plugin also disables the nag which prompts you to connect to WooCommerce.com


## Set and forget

Everything is disabled automatically when the plugin is activated. Deactivating will bring back the nags.

## Why does this plugin exist?

I personally like my WordPress sites to be as clean and ad free as possible.
