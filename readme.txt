Disable WooCommerce Marketplace suggestions, ads and connect to woocommerce.com nags.

== Description ==

## Remove WooCommerce 3.6 Extension Ads

This plugin disables the WooCommerce Marketplace suggestions. The suggestions appear in the admin area. They can be located in-between your product list and on product edit pages. These might be useful to newcomers, but they can be a distraction to everyone else.

## Remove the "Connect your store to WooCommerce.com to receive extensions updates and support."

This plugin also disables the admin nag which prompts you to connect to WooCommerce.com

## Does this work on 3.5?

Yes, you can active Clean WooCommerce before upgrading to WooCommerce 3.6. The plugin will still remove the "Connect to woocommerce.com" admin nag.

## Set and forget

Everything is disabled automatically when the plugin is activated. Deactivating will bring back the admin nags.

## Why does this plugin exist?

Ads can be distracting and take away from the experience of running an online business. I personally like my WordPress sites to be as clean and advertisement free as possible.

== Installation ==

Note: This plugin requires WooCommerce to be installed.

Download and upload the Clean WooCommerce plugin to your /wp-content/plugin/ directory or through the Plugin admin section under “add new”.,
Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress.,

That’s it!
